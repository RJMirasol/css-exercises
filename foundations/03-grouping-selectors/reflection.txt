Note:

Once again I manage to get the outcome needed to follow 
but my solution is different from Odins solution. 

Odin used grouping selector and only used one class 
attribute on both buttons element vs my solution to use 2 
class for both buttons.

Not sure if having two classes is bad - will have to do 
research if so. I will keep in mind Odins solution as its 
more clearer and cleaner!
