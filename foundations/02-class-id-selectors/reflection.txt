Note:
I have manage to copy the same style as the outcome.png, but my CSS code is so messy and not good in the eyes of the 
propessionals. I think i need to go back to understading class and id as to refresh my memory on how to use them 
properly. 


Pointers:
In this assignment, you really need to pay attetion to the details of the outcom picture. By doing so you will be able 
to see the difference in text which in my case leads me to assuming that they all have the same font-family style.

With HTML class and id - you can use 2 or more class type using space in between values (syntax: class="class1 
class2). With id - you can olny use a uniqe id in your page (do not use same id in different elements etc.) you can 
also add a class property with the id property in the opening tag of the element. 

ENJOY and KEEP WORKING AT IT!
