Flex 02 Assignment

Manage to copy the desired outcome but target different rules when in reality the solution is way simplier that what i imagined. In 
My solution-Flow of thinking :I need to make .header a flex container by adding display: flex; and to align the flex items 
horizontaly I added justify-content: space-between; due to the desired outcome having space in between. I saw that the logo's box is 
bigger than the desired outcome so decided to add margin for top and bottom to 6px reduce the size where the solution didnt even 
touch the .logo rule instead it adds a padding to .header of 8px which solves the issue. I also did try making the .logo a flex item 
but wasted it since its already inheriting it from the .header. I then turn to the unordered list .ul rule and made it a flex item. 
I then think of a way to separate the list and manage to remember i can do so by adding the gap: and setting it to 15px (only 
guesstimate) which solutions shows it was the correct way (only way smaller than my answer). The only thing i didnt do is adding the 
margin and padding to 0. Well i actualy added padding with 8px (seems to do the job? :)). Did made the anchor tag a flex item as 
well but looks like its a really wrong move LOL.

Self-note:
- need to review boxes again to remember how to set padding and margin properlly.
- do not overcomplate the solution and try to understant whats needed and see if i can make the code more readable and concise.
- will try my best on the next one :)
