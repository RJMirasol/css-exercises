04-flex-information Assignment 

Solutions/Thoughts:
- Every thing should be centered - I have to think of a way to make it happen - I did create new div's for title and info's which will then make all the items a flex items. README.MD instructed that I will need to change the HMTL witch gave me the idea too.

- after the changes with the HMTL file - I then start making the items flex by adding .title-center rule giving it display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-bottom: 32px; and margin 0:

- I then turn my attention to items 1-4 - first by making it a flex items by creating .items rule with dispel flex;, justify-content: space-around; gap: 25px;. (I was mistaken as I used flex: 1; which is not needed)

- due to not Understanding the instruction - also created .img rule to make then Flex Time and to centre them justify-content (which is not needed as well since it is inheriting the property from its parent)

- I manage to solve the creating new div's on each individual infos - the only mistake was I created different class thinking I have to target them separately. I then created a group selector from item-1 to -4 and created them as flex items with properties display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: centre; width: 200px; which made everything looks like the desired outcome.

- only problem is I can't remember how to centre the text - I kept thinking but nothing is coming up so I had to rest for a bit. When I came back I remember it was text so I created a .text rule with property text-align: center; - which solves the issue.


Self Note:
In the solution HTML I should've left the information title as itself a block content and just target the body element and just used text-align: center; - who would know its this simple :(

Try to lessen the use of all the flex attribute and make sure to just use what is needed.

Keep in my if you are targeting all items with same property - just use 1 class name so the code is not messy and will be easier to read - less confusion
